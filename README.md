# Taetz_Bordelius_Continual_ImageCaptioning
Continual learning Image Captioning model with catastrophic forgetting mitigation techniques.

Our model beats previous state of the art results set by ContCap: A Scalable Framework for Continual Image Captioning.

Our best results with continual learning on ContCap continual MS COCO dataset split:
- BLEU-1: 66.4
- BLEU-2: 47.9
- BLEU-3: 31.8
- BLEU-4: 21.8
- ROUGE-1: 41.8
- ROUGE-2: 15.1
- ROUGE-L: 37.0
